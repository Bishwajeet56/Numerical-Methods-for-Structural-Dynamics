# Numerical-Methods-for-Structural-Dynamics
This repository contains code for solving typical problems in structural dynamics using numerical methods, specifically the Newmark-Beta method.

Q1:Underdamped case
A mass of 100 kg is connected with a spring of 10 kN/m. There is a damper of 200 N/s attached to it. The mass is at rest at 0.02 m from the equilibrium position.

Q2: Critically damped case
Changing the damping value from 200 N/s to 2000 N/s.

Q3: Overdamped case:
Change the damping value from 200 N/s to 20000 N/s.

Q4: A sinusoidal acceleration xg_dot_dot = sin (2*pi*t) is applied to a mass of 100 kg. The mass is connected with a spring of stiffness 10 kN/m and viscous damper of damping 200 Ns/m.
