# Numerical-Methods-for-Structural-Dynamics
This repository contains code for solving typical problems in structural dynamics using numerical methods, specifically the Newmark-Beta method.

Q1:Underdamped case
A mass of 100 kg is connected with a spring of 10 kN/m. There is a damper of 200 N/s attached to it. The mass is at rest at .02 m from the equilibrium position.

Q2: Critically damped case
Changing the damping value from 200 N/s to 2000 N/s.
